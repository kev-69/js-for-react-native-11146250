# TASK 1
1. After writting the function statement, I declared a variable and set it to an empty array to store the resulting processed array
2. I then loop through the number passed in as parameters to the function.
2. a. I first check to see if the number is even, then I square it and push it into the empty array declared earlier.
2. b. But then if the number is not even, then it is definitely odd, then it will be trippled and then pushed into the array declare earlier.
3. Finally, I return the processed array.



# TASK 2
1. Wrote a function that takes teo parameters; a string and array of numbers.
2. I loop through the each string character and its corresponding processed number in the array.
3. I initialise str to the string's index and num to the array's index.
4. Then I check using an if statement to see if the number is even and if it is, I convert it to uppercase letter and push the corresponding string to the formatted string to the array. Else if it is not, then it is odd, I convert it to lower case and push it into the array.
5. Lastly, return the formatter strings array.
