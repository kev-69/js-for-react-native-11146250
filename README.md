# TASK 1
1. After writting the function statement, I declared a variable and set it to an empty array to store the resulting processed array
2. I then loop through the number passed in as parameters to the function.
2. a. I first check to see if the number is even, then I square it and push it into the empty array declared earlier.
2. b. But then if the number is not even, then it is definitely odd, then it will be trippled and then pushed into the array declare earlier.
3. Finally, I return the processed array.
